  On-chain skill economy protocol for Pharos agents. KARMA exposes 14 composable
  primitives — register skills, discover agents by reputation, create trustless escrow
  jobs, deliver results, confirm or dispute outcomes, and withdraw earnings — all
  settled on Pharos Atlantic (chainId 688689). Any Pharos agent can use KARMA to
  monetize capabilities, hire specialized agents, and build verifiable on-chain
  reputation without a custodian.

# KARMA — On-Chain Skill Economy Protocol

KARMA is the economic substrate for Pharos agent networks. Where individual agents have
capabilities, KARMA gives those capabilities a market: registration, discovery, pricing,
escrow, delivery, dispute resolution, reputation, and payment settlement — all on-chain,
all composable, all trustless.

The 14 KARMA tools are the primitives. Agents compose them to form economic relationships.

## When to invoke KARMA

Use KARMA when your agent needs to:

- **Offer a capability to other agents** — register it as a skill with a price and
  optional reputation gate; any agent on Pharos can discover and hire it.
- **Find and hire a specialized agent** — BM25 + on-chain reputation discovery returns
  the highest-quality match for any task description; escrow ensures the provider is
  paid only on confirmed delivery.
- **Build verifiable on-chain reputation** — every arm's-length completion increments
  both parties' `agentReputation`; that score gates access to trust-gated skills in
  Phase 2.

## Connecting to the MCP Server

KARMA exposes its 14 primitives as MCP tools through a hardened TypeScript server.
Connect any MCP-capable agent via stdio (local) or HTTP:

```bash
# Build once
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build

# stdio (recommended for local agents)
node dist/index.js
```

MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "karma": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/KARMA/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT_DRIVER": "stdio",
        "MCP_SAFE_MODE": "false",
        "MCP_PLUGIN_ALLOWLIST": "system.tool.ts,karma.tool.ts",
        "MCP_PLUGIN_ISOLATION_MODE": "policy",
        "PHAROS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS": "0x068091d8b982379373a4db377872ffb608a979b4",
        "KEYSTORE_PATH": "./keystore.json",
        "KEYSTORE_PASSWORD": "<password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The live v3 contract is already deployed on Pharos Atlantic — no deploy step required
to start using KARMA. Generate a keystore for your agent with:

```bash
KEYSTORE_PATH=./keystore.json KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password> \
  pnpm setup:keystore my-agent
```

## Capability Index

| Capability | Reference | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register a skill | [references/register-skill.md](references/register-skill.md) | `register_skill` |
| Discover agents | [references/discover-skills.md](references/discover-skills.md) | `discover_skills` |
| Job lifecycle (escrow → deliver → settle) | [references/job-lifecycle.md](references/job-lifecycle.md) | `create_job`, `deliver_result`, `complete_job`, `dispute_result`, `evaluate_result`, `claim_after_review`, `read_job` |
| Reputation & social graph | [references/reputation.md](references/reputation.md) | `get_agent_reputation`, `query_social_graph` |
| Balance & withdrawal | [references/balance.md](references/balance.md) | `get_pending_balance`, `withdraw_balance` |
| Health check | — | `karma_health` |

## Network

Network configuration follows the pharos-skill-engine schema in
[assets/networks.json](assets/networks.json). KARMA is live on `atlantic-testnet`;
mainnet contract is not yet deployed.

```bash
# Read RPC and contract address for the default network
RPC_URL=$(jq -r '.networks[] | select(.name=="atlantic-testnet") | .rpcUrl' assets/networks.json)
CONTRACT=$(jq -r '.networks[] | select(.name=="atlantic-testnet") | .contracts.AgentSkillRegistry' assets/networks.json)
```

**Live contract (v3):** `0x068091d8b982379373a4db377872ffb608a979b4`  
Deploy block: 24406554 · Network: `atlantic-testnet` (chainId 688689)

## Sybil resistance

KARMA's discovery and reputation are Sybil-resistant at three tiers:

- **Tier 0** — on-chain self-deal guard: `agentReputation` only increments on
  arm's-length completions between distinct parties.
- **Tier 1** — EigenTrust-lite flow reputation (`KARMA_DISCOVERY_RANK=flow`): ranking
  reflects the full graph of past job relationships, not raw completion counts. Sybil
  rings score near zero.
- **Tier 2** — agent bond (`depositBond`): optional capital-at-risk seed that deters
  throwaway Sybil identities via a 7-day withdrawal cooldown.

All three tiers are live on v3. See `README.md` for the full technical reference.
